Ext.ux.api.Fullscreen
=====================

Add support for HTML5 API on Ext components.

Plugin for Ext components that add standarized support for the fullscreen API. 
Work with all modern browsers.
Components that have floating children do not work properly. 
This happens because these children are not children of the component in the DOM tree.
